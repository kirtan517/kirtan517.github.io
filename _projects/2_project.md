## Text Classification: Human vs LLM
The goal of this project was to discern between text written by humans and text generated by a Language Model (LLM). To accomplish this, a custom transformer model was trained, equipped with a tailored tokenizer. The model achieved commendable accuracy, as depicted in the Confusion Matrix below.
