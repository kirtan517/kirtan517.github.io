 I am `Kirtan`, a seasoned professional who recently earned a `Master's of Engineering` degree from the prestigious `University of Waterloo`. Throughout my academic journey, I immersed myself in the dynamic realm of artificial intelligence, contributing significantly to various AI projects and engaging in cutting-edge software-related endeavors.

My educational foundation was laid at Svnit, where I earned my bachelor's degree. It was during my final year at Svnit that I delved into an AI project focused on climate classification, showcasing my early passion for the intersection of technology and environmental solutions.

Over the years, I have diligently honed my expertise in AI, undertaking a diverse range of projects that have not only enriched my skills but have also fueled my curiosity for algorithmic complexities. This evolving interest has become a focal point in my recent endeavors.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I find solace in the world of anime and literature. Whether engrossed in captivating animated tales or exploring the depths of thought-provoking books, my leisure time is a balance of relaxation and intellectual stimulation.
